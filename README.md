# CPSC 4100 Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
**Final Project**

You may code in C++ or C#, using the free (student) licenses available on [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) for effective IDEs. Individual files must be uploaded to Canvas.  
**Do NOT upload projects or zip files.**

## 1. In C++ (CLion) or C# (Rider), to solve the 0-1 Knapsack problem, implement:
   - **a)** an optimal (yes, exponential) algorithm  
   - **b)** a DP approach to solve the algorithm 
     - **i.** Use the same language for implementation as in **a)**

## 2. Construct, or reuse with acknowledgement, a few data sets:
   - **a)** You may generate several data sets separately  
   - **b)** Or, you may generate one large data set and construct smaller data sets from subsets, as long as the data sets used are sufficiently varied  
   - **c)** Scalability of the different implementations is contrasted via differently sized sets  

## 3. Run both implementations on the same data sets:
   - **a)** Note outcome and run time differences  
   - **b)** Clearly specify what time is measured. For details, see:
     - [Measure Execution Time in C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/measure-execution-time-function-cpp/)
     - [8 Ways to Measure Execution Time in C/C++](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/8-ways-to-measure-execution-time-in-c-c-48634458d0f9)
     
## 4. For each implementation, analyze:
   - **a)** Algorithmic complexity  
   - **b)** Code complexity  
   - **c)** Data analysis performed within the code  
   - **d)** Observed (actual) performance on each data set  
     - **i.** Display results clearly in a table  
     - **ii.** Include observed run-times on different data sets  

## 5. Summarize your findings by comparing the two implementations. Explain differences in:
   - **a)** Algorithmic complexity  
   - **b)** Code complexity  
   - **c)** Data analysis performed with code  
   - **d)** Observed (actual) performance of each implementation. Comment on:
     - **i.** Run-times on different data sets  
     - **ii.** Scalability  
     - **iii.** The impact of input size AND the knapsack capacity  

## 6. Submit, on Canvas:
   - **a)** Code file(s) for #1a and #1b â€“ individual file, no projects or zip files  
   - **b)** Code for #2 generating data sets (or link if code/data reused)  
   - **c)** File (doc, docx, pdf) that:
     - **i.** Satisfies #4 & #5 above  
     - **ii.** Explains how the requirements of the assignment were fulfilled  
     - **iii.** Provides details of runs conducted  
     - **iv.** Includes one or more tables, as specified above
